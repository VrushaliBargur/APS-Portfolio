In such cases, algorithms like Least Connections or Weighted Round Robin are better suited.<\/li><li><strong>Session Persistence<\/strong>: Some applications require that a user\u2019s session remains consistent, meaning that each user should interact with the same server for the duration of their session. Algorithms like IP Hash or sticky sessions address this challenge.<\/li><li><strong>Handling Failures<\/strong>: Load balancing algorithms must account for server failures and automatically reroute traffic to healthy servers. This requires regular health checks and robust fault tolerance mechanisms.<\/li><li><strong>Complex Queries<\/strong>: Some load balancing algorithms may struggle with complex queries that span multiple servers. It\u2019s essential to design systems with load balancing in mind to avoid issues like cross-shard queries in distributed databases.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Best Practices for Load Balancing Algorithms<\/h2><ul><li><strong>Monitor Server Health<\/strong>: Continuously monitor the health and performance of servers to ensure that traffic is routed only to healthy servers.

For example, Weighted Least Connections may be more effective in a heterogeneous environment where server capabilities vary.Configure Auto-Scaling Integrate load balancing with auto-scaling mechanisms to add or remove servers based on traffic demands. This ensures that your system can handle spikes in traffic without manual intervention.Implement Session Persistence For applications that require session persistence (such as e-commerce sites), make sure to configure sticky sessions or use algorithms like IP Hash to ensure users are consistently routed to the same server.Use Load Balancers with High Availability Ensure that your load balancer itself is highly available and can handle failover scenarios. Using multiple load balancers in active-passive or active-active configurations can prevent single points of failure.Why Learn Load Balancing Algorithms?Improved System Design Learning how to implement load balancing algorithms helps you design more robust and scalable systems, ensuring that they can handle increased traffic and user demands.Performance Optimization By understanding load balancing, you can optimize the performance of applications and reduce response times, which enhances the user experience.Critical for Large-Scale Systems Load balancing is an essential concept for designing and maintaining large-scale systems, such as web servers, cloud services, and e-commerce platforms, which need to handle high traffic efficiently.Fault Tolerance and Availability By implementing the right load balancing strategy, you can ensure that your system is fault-tolerant and maintains high availability, even during peak traffic periods or in case of server failures.Topics CoveredIntroduction to Load Balancing Algorithms Learn the basics of load balancing and why its crucial for performance and scalability.Types of Load Balancing Algorithms Explore different load balancing algorithms like Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.Importance of Load Balancing Understand the benefits of load balancing, including improved scalability, performance, and availability.Common Challenges and Best Practices Discover the challenges associated with load balancing and the best practices for using load balancing algorithms effectively.For more details, check out the full article on GeeksforGeeks Load Balancing Algorithms.","thumbnailUrl":["https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/LoadBalancingAlgorithms/LoadBalancingAlgorithms20241118124534.jpg","https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/LoadBalancingAlgorithms/LoadBalancingAlgorithms20241118124534-seo.png","https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/LoadBalancingAlgorithms/LoadBalancingAlgorithms20241118124534-small.png"],"uploadDate":"2024-11-18T12:45:54Z","duration":"PT0H11M26S","contentUrl":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/videos/load-balancing-algorithms/"}</script>

  "description": "To control traffic across servers in a network, load-balancing algorithms are important. By spreading requests evenly, load balancers make sure that no single server is overloaded when several people visit an application. Various techniques, such as IP hash, Least Connections, and Round Robin, are employed, depending on the traffic patterns",

Consider that you have a group of employees and numerous jobs to finish. To keep everyone active and complete the work efficiently, you should split the tasks evenly rather than assigning one person to perform all the work while others sit around doing nothing. In computing, load balancing accomplishes exactly that.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Load balancing algorithms can be broadly categorized into two types:</span><b><strong>&nbsp;Dynamic load balancing</strong></b><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><b><strong>Static load balancing.</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><img src="./Load Balancing Algorithms - GeeksforGeeks_files/llba.webp" alt="llba" width="1001" height="501" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183244/llba.webp 1001w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183244/llba-100.webp 100w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183244/llba-200.webp 200w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183244/llba-300.webp 300w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183244/llba-660.webp 660w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183244/llba-768.webp 768w" loading="lazy"></p><div id="GFG_AD_Desktop_InContent_ATF_728x280" style="text-align: center; margin: 10px 0px; display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1.5em;"><div id="GFG_AD_Desktop_InContent_ATF_300x250_1" data-google-query-id="CLT08MSS4I0DFd1HnQkdjX0tNA" style="width: 320px; max-width: 300px; max-height: 250px; overflow: hidden;"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/27823234/gfg_desktop_incontent_300x250_la_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none; width: 300px; height: 0px;"></div></div></div><h2 id="1-static-load-balancing-algorithms"><u><span class="GFGEditorTheme__textUnderline">Static Load Balancing Algorithms</span></u></h2><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span>Static load balancing involves predetermined assignment of tasks or resources without considering real-time variations in the system.

This is like Round Robin – making sure everyone gets a fair share.</span></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><img src="./Load Balancing Algorithms - GeeksforGeeks_files/Round-Robin-(1).webp" alt="Round-Robin-(1)" width="1001" height="500" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183312/Round-Robin-(1).webp 1001w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183312/Round-Robin-(1)-100.webp 100w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183312/Round-Robin-(1)-200.webp 200w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183312/Round-Robin-(1)-300.webp 300w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183312/Round-Robin-(1)-660.webp 660w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183312/Round-Robin-(1)-768.webp 768w" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We need to implement a basic Round Robin load balancing algorithm.

Source IP Hash Load Balancing Algorithm</span></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>The Source IP Hash Load Balancing Algorithm is a method used in network load balancing to distribute incoming requests among a set of servers based on the hash value of the source IP address. This algorithm aims to ensure that requests originating from the same source IP address are consistently directed to the same server.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>If the load balancer is configured for session persistence, it ensures that subsequent requests from the same source IP address are consistently directed to the same server. This is beneficial for applications that require maintaining session information or state.</span></p><h3 id="for-example-2"><b><strong>For example:</strong></b></h3><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>Think of your friends coming to your house, and you want to remember who gets which toy every time they visit. IP Hash is like remembering which friend played with which toy last time, so you always give them the same one.</span></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><img src="./Load Balancing Algorithms - GeeksforGeeks_files/Source-IP-hash--(1).webp" alt="Source-IP-hash--(1)" width="1001" height="500" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183502/Source-IP-hash--(1).webp 1001w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183502/Source-IP-hash--(1)-100.webp 100w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183502/Source-IP-hash--(1)-200.webp 200w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183502/Source-IP-hash--(1)-300.webp 300w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183502/Source-IP-hash--(1)-660.webp 660w,https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240130183502/Source-IP-hash--(1)-768.webp 768w" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We need to implement a load balancing algorithm that distributes incoming requests across a set of servers based on the hash of the source IP address.
